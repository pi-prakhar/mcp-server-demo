To make the `NOTES_FILE` path more universal and work relative to the location of `main.py`, modify the current hardcoded path:

```python
NOTES_FILE = "/Users/prakhar/Documents/personal-projects/MCP/mcp-server-demo/notes.txt"
```

For better portability, change it to use a path relative to the script itself:

```python
import os

# Define notes file path relative to main.py location
NOTES_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "notes.txt")
```

This ensures the notes file will be created in the same directory as the `main.py` script, making the application more portable across different systems and installations.
